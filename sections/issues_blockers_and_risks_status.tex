\section{Issues, Blockers, and Risks Status}

% !!! Reference back to the project plan !!!

% Identify any issues or blockers that are currently affecting the project.
% Outline the steps being taken to mitigate these concerns.

% Identifies any problems or obstacles hindering the progress and potential risks, along with their resolution or mitigation plans.

A number of issues were identified, and in an attempt to minimise their impact on the project they were combined with a mitigation action. The issues and their corresponding mitigation plan can be seen in Table.\:\ref{tab:issues_and_mitigation}. 
\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{All identified issues and the steps being taken to mitigate them.}
    \label{tab:issues_and_mitigation}
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
         \textbf{Issue} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\ \hline
         1.5 nav2 stack error & Accepted that sufficient resources were not available to solve the problem. Choosing not to waste more resources. The use of \ac{slam}, despite not being optimal or the initial goal, was accepted as a temporary solution \\ \hline
         1.3.2 \acs{foc} wizard in MC Workbench 6 not working and causing strange problems (a problem encountered by other \acs{ssl} teams as well, including Delft Mercurians) & Given the importance of motor control, the activity could not be cancelled, hence any spare work force was allocated to the task \\ \hline
         1.3.2 \acs{uart} functionality generated by STM32CubeMX not working. Items are sent but the received items are incorrect. Furthermore, the STM32CubeIDE is causing what almost seems like non-deterministic errors (which is not unsurprising given its buggy state) & Additional aid from Pontus Svensson \\ \hline 
         1.6 Misunderstandings regarding how the \acs{ai} algorithm works (\acs{mappo}) & Contact the people who developed the algorithm \\ \hline
         1.6 Problems with poor documentation of the tools used (PyTorch C++ library) & Accept \\ \hline
         2.1.3.3 Fitting the dribbler assembly in a way which still allows for optimal ability to catch the ball & Left as future work, can be solved with a different dribbler motor \\ \hline
         2.1.3.3 Dribbler motor not working. Ordered another one, but it will not arrive in time & Accept \\ \hline
         2.2 Components being delivered late or not being delivered at all & Accept \\ \hline
         Limited time and resources resulting in inability to develop a number of necessary functionalities (\acs{hil}, send and receive information, robot initialization, ability to switch playing half, get robot status information, computer vision, kicker interface, dribbler interface, velocity distributor, sensor fusion, communication protocol), finish constructing the robot (\acs{pcb}, dribbler, basestation, wheel encoders), or perform proper testing & Accept \\ \hline
